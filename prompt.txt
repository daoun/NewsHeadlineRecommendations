Please kindly have Christine submit her solution before Monday July 22nd.  Iâ€™m happy to provide clarifications at any time.


Purpose

IBM has a corporate communications team which publishes news headlines to the internal homepage for roughly half a million employees, consultants, and business partners.  Please design and implement a simple recommendation system to match relevant news headlines to internal employees.  


Assumptions 

For the purpose of this technical assessment, please assume that the employee records are stored in a file, and the news headlines are stored in another file.  

 

An employee record has at least the following fields
ID
name
location
job role
department

A news headline has at least the following fields
title
abstract
language
publication date
author

Please feel free to add more fields to either employee or news headline as you see fit.


Minimum Requirements

1. Generate a text file named employee.txt with 5,000 - 10,000 records
2. Generate a text file named headlines.txt with 500 - 3,000 records
3. Implement a service which recommends news headlines to employees such that
	1. matching is performed on the publication date 
	2. this services should have a public API that takes the publication date as input and outputs every news headline published on this day to its list of matched employees
4. Please include documentation on how to run/invoke/install this service. GitHub is recommended.
 

Other Considerations

	- Ideally, this service would be implemented in a cloud native manner.  IBM Cloud would be the best choice, other popular cloud provider such as AWS or Azure are also good.
	- Ideally, your submissions should represent production level work, so please include test coverage if you normally test your code and provide documentation if you normally provide documentation.
	- Optionally, you can to take this service to the next level!  You may either implement more APIs or document your next steps.  
Optionally, describe how you would handle a million employees and three hundred million news headlines across the globe
